          <p>Python is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
          It is a small and lightweight language.
          Inside a host environment, Python can be connected to the objects of
        its environment to provide programmatic control them.</p>

        <p>Python contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date,
        and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control
        structures, and statements. Core Python can be extended for a
        variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
        example:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            class html.parser.HTMLParser(*, convert_charrefs=True)
            Create a parser instance able to parse invalid markup.
            If convert_charrefs is True (the default), all character references (except the ones in script/style elements) are automatically converted to the corresponding Unicode characters.
            An HTMLParser instance is fed HTML data and calls handler methods when start tags, end tags, text, comments, and other markup elements are encountered. The user should subclass HTMLParser and override its methods to implement the desired behavior.
            This parser does not check that end tags match start tags or call the end-tag handler for elements which are closed implicitly by closing an outer element.
            Changed in version 3.4: convert_charrefs keyword argument added.
            Changed in version 3.5: The default value for argument convert_charrefs is now True.

          </li>
          <li>Server-side Python extends the core language by supplying objects
          relevant to running Python on a server. For example, server-side
          extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
          provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of
          the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>

            have the following basic
            background:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>A general purpose programming language.</li>
              <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of

          <p>Python comes preinstalled on most Linux distributions, and is available as a package on all others.
            However there are certain features you might want to use that are not available on your distro’s package.
            You can easily compile the latest version of Python from source.</p>
          <p>
            If you want to compile CPython yourself, first thing you should do is get the source. You can download either the latest release’s source or just grab a fresh clone. (If you want to contribute patches, you will need a clone.)
            The build process consists of the usual commands:

            ./configure
            make
            make install
          </p>
          <p>
            Python is a free and open source language widely used in scripting and system administration under linux.

          To get started with writing code, open the python interpreter and write your
      first "Hello world" Python code:
      <br>
      <code>
        print("Hello World!")
      </code>
      <br>
      launch the interpreter and excecute this command.

        <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The
          names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
        <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_);
          subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).</p>
        <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers.
      You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in
      identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and
      _name.

          You can declare a variable in three ways:
<p>
   <code>y_x = 42</code> This syntax is called snakecase
</p>
<p>
  By simply assigning it a value. For example, <code> x = 42 </code> This is the most simple syntax.

  For example, <code>XyX = 1</code> This syntax is called camelcase.

          <p>Local Scope
             A variable created inside a function belongs to the local scope of that function, and can only be used inside that function.</p>
             <br>
             <code>

              x = 300

            Global Variables
            Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples above) are known as global variables.
            Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you create a variable with the same name inside a function, this variable will be local, and can only be used inside the function. The global variable with the same name will remain as it was, global and with the original value.

        <article>
          <p>
            Constants
            A constant is a type of variable whose value cannot be changed. It is helpful to think of constants as containers that hold information which cannot be changed later.
            You can think of constants as a bag to store some books which cannot be replaced once placed inside the bag.
          </p>
          <code>
            PI = 3.14
            GRAVITY = 9.8
            import constant
          </code>
          <p>
            Assigning value to constant in Python
            In Python, constants are usually declared and assigned in a module.
            Here, the module is a new file containing variables, functions, etc which is imported to the main file.
            Inside the module, constants are written in all capital letters and underscores separating the words.
          </p>
            <code>
            print(constant.PI)
            print(constant.GRAVITY)
          </code>
          <p>
            The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope
            variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to
            represent a variable.
          </p>
          <p>
        You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
        variable in the same scope.

      <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
        <header>Data types</header>
        <article>
          <p>The modules described in this chapter provide a variety of specialized data types such as dates and times, fixed-type arrays, heap queues, double-ended queues, and enumerations.</p>
          <p>7 data types are primitives:</p>
          <br>
          <ul>
            <li>Boolean, true or false</li>
            <li>dict</li>
            <li>list</li>
            <li>set</li>
            <li>frozenset</li>
            <li>Tuples</li>
            <li>And Objects</li>
          </ul>
          Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you
      to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions
      are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of
      objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that
      your application can perform.

          Python Conditions and If statements

Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

    Equals: a == b
    Not Equals: a != b
    Less than: a < b
    Less than or equal to: a <= b
    Greater than: a > b
    Greater than or equal to: a >= b

These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.
      <code>
        a = 33
        b = 200
        if b > a:
        print("b is greater than a")
      </code>
      condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
      Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
      condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
      statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any statement,
      including further nested if statements.
      <p>
        You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
        conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
      </p>
      <code>
        if a > b: print("a is greater than b")
      </code>
      In this example a is greater than b, so the first condition is not true, also the elif condition is not true,
      so we go to the else condition and print to screen that "a is greater than b".
      You can also have an else without the elif:
      <code>
        a = 33
        b = 33
        if b > a:
        print("b is greater than a")
        elif a == b:
        print("a and b are equal")
      </code>
      Else;
      The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.
      <code>
        a = 200
        b = 33
        if b > a:
        print("b is greater than a")
        elif a == b:
        print("a and b are equal")
        else:
        print("a is greater than b")
      </code>
      In this example a is greater than b, so the first condition is not true, also the elif condition is not true,
      so we go to the else condition and print to screen that "a is greater than b".
      You can also have an else without the elif:
      <code>
        a = 200
        b = 33
        if b > a:
        print("b is greater than a")
        else:
        print("b is not greater than a")
      </code>

          Python Loops

          Python has two primitive loop commands:

          while loops
          for loops

          The while Loop:
          With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
      <code>
        i = 1
        while i < 6:
        print(i)
        i += 1
      </code>
      The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready, in this example we need to define an indexing variable, i, which we set to 1.
      <p>
        The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed. If
        the condition returns true, statement is executed and the condition is
        tested again. If the condition returns false, execution stops and
        control is passed to the statement following while.
      </p>
      <p>
      The Python break statement immediately terminates a loop entirely. Program execution proceeds to the first statement following the loop body.
      The Python continue statement immediately terminates the current loop iteration. Execution jumps to the top of the loop, and the controlling expression is re-evaluated to determine whether the loop will execute again or terminate.
      </p>
      Example:
      <p>Here’s a script file called break.py that demonstrates the break statement:</p>
      <code>
        n = 5
        while n > 0:
        n -= 1
        if n == 2:
        break
        print(n)
        print('Loop ended.')
      </code>
      <p>
        With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
        Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>After the first pass: n = 1</li>
        <li>After the second pass: n = 2</li>
        <li>After the third pass: n = 3</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
        true, so the loop terminates.
      </p>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Function_declarations">
        <header>Function declarations</header>
        <article>
          A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
     statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:
     <ul>
       <li>The name of the function.</li>
       <li>
         A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
         separated by commas.
       </li>
       <li>
         The Python statements that define the function, enclosed in curly
         parenthesis, ( ).
       </li>
     </ul>
     <p>
       For example, the following code defines a simple function named food:
     </p>
     <code>
       def my_function(food):
       for x in food:
        print(x)

        fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

      my_function(fruits)
     </code>
     <p>
       You can send any data types of argument to a function (string, number, list, dictionary etc.),
       and it will be treated as the same data type inside the function.
     </p>
     <p>
       To let a function return a value, use the return statement:
     </p>
     <code>
  def my_function(x):
    return 5 * x

  print(my_function(3))
  print(my_function(5))
  print(my_function(9))
     </code>
